2. Set up model serving infrastructure (vLLM/TensorRT-LLM)
3. Deploy base coding models (Code Llama 13B/34B)
4. Implement basic completion and refactoring features
5. Set up monitoring and logging systems

### Phase 2: Cloud Integration (Months 2-3)
1. Integrate cloud API services
2. Implement intelligent routing system
3. Set up cost monitoring and usage controls
4. Deploy advanced agentic features
5. User training and gradual rollout

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 3-6)
